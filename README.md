# Astroskills Final Project
*Ana Lam, December 2025*
## Hierarchical Bayesian Tail Light Curve Models for Type IIP SN

Project write up: [`notebooks/project.ipynb`](https://github.com/ana-lam/astroskills_final/blob/main/notebooks/project.ipynb)

Demo of predicted tails from model: [`notebooks/generate_model_tail_LCs.ipynb`](https://github.com/ana-lam/astroskills_final/blob/main/notebooks/generate_model_tail_LCs.ipynb)

Model assessment: [`notebooks/model_assessment.ipynb`](https://github.com/ana-lam/astroskills_final/blob/main/notebooks/model_assessment.ipynb)

*Resource Acknowledgement: AI was used to generate code regarding special plotting formats, dataframe manipulation, and selecting computing parameters for sampler + `PyMC` dependency conflict resolution.*

*To run the code please install `requirements.in` to a conda environment. I had trouble getting `pymc` to play nicely in `uv` + `venv`.*
