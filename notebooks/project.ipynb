    "### Hierarchical Bayesian LC Models for late-time WISE data in Type IIP SN\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Type IIP SNe are powerful probes of the final stages of massive stellar evolution. They are the most common SN (60-70% of observed SNe), come from H-rich progenitors (progenitors that have retained their H envelope), and are expected to be the end stage of the lower mass boundary of stars that undergo CCSN. \n",
    "\n",
    "The luminosity and shape of Type IIP SNe light curves encode many key physical quantities regarding the progenitors and the explosions themselves. Specifically, the luminosity of the radioactive tail can be used to derive the synthesized nickel mass, $M_\\text{Ni}$, and thus in turn inform us about the structure of the progenitor star.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L \\propto M_\\text{Ni}e^{-t/\\tau_\\text{Co}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The most comprehensive analyzed sample of ZTF Type IIP SNe light curves in [Das 2025b](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20068) demonstrated a strong correlation between the bolometric luminosity at the plateau phase, a good indicator of the explosion energy, and the derived $M_\\text{Ni}$ from the radioactive tail. However, within this comprehensive sample, there are outlier events that exhibit stronger bolometric luminosity for the plateau phase and lower derived $M_\\text{Ni}$.\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "These anomalous Type IIP SNe have dramatic cut offs in their radioactive tails. These unusually low $M_\\text{Ni}$ can be potential flags for candidate partial fallback explosions, where a significant fraction of the inner ejecta fails to escape in the explosion and falls back onto the compact object remnant. To confidently flag these partial fallback candidates, one needs to rule out that the optical tail luminosity is absorbed by dust formed in the SNe and re-emitted in the mid-infrared.\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In my research, I am focusing on the Das sample of $\\sim 100$ Type IIP SNe discovered by ZTF. The subsample of anomalous sources, with steep radioactive tail drop-offs, are prime partial fallback candidates if there faint tails cannot be explained by dust reprocessing. In order to do this I build SEDs from ZTF and WISE data and fit dust radiative transfer models. However, only a subset of the sample has contemporaneous ZTF and WISE data in the tail phase, limiting the number of SNe for which I can model the optical+IR SED directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, I will use a hierarchical Bayesian light-curve model for the late-time optical light curve as a way to statistically infer the $g$, $r$, and $i$ band flux throughout the tail epoch for SNe that lack coincident ZTF and WISE coverage. Using the subset of SNe with coincident ZTF and WISE data, I will fit a population-level model for the ZTF flux as a function of radioactive tail phase, allowing each SN to have its own decline behavior. This hierarchical model will then provide posterior predictions for the ZTF flux at a specific tail epoch for SNe with missing ZTF data near the sparse WISE detections in the tail epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining the inferred ZTF fluxes with the WISE photometry in the tail epoch, I can construct tail-phase optical+IR SEDs for a much larger fraction of Type IIP SNe from the total sample compared to when relying only on raw data. With this expanded sample, I can continue to model how much tail luminosity is reprocessed by dust, derive true $M_\\text{Ni}$, reassess outliers after accounting for dust, and confidently flag anomalously low-$M_\\text{Ni}$ objects as partial fallback candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Population-level Hierarchical Tail Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The radioactive tail phase of optical light curves of Type IIP SNe can be described by a simple parametric model whose parameters vary across individual SN but can come from a population distribution. I'll first fit that population-level model and then use it to infer the $g$, $r$, and $i$ band flux at times where we have WISE observations for the SN tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Das 2025b](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20068) uses a Gaussian Process algorithm to model the $r$ and $g$ band light curves. They do this for each SN individually and then adopt a MC approach to estimate uncertainties on epochs. They also adopt semi-analytic models, radiation-hydrodynamical model grids, and scaling grids to derive properties for each SN.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a population-level hierarchical model, I hope to leverage well-sampled and typical SNe to infer optical flux coincident with our confident WISE observations in the tail epoch. These can in turn be used as probabilistic constraints in the SED fits and dust modeling portion.\n",
